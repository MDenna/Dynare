# Monetary-Theory
Codes from graduate course in Monetary Theory (Winter 2017).
The codes in the Monetary Theory repository involve projects completed during the final semester of the M.A. Economics program. Included are my raw codes from the projects due over the course of the semester in order to illustrate proficiency with coding in MATLAB (Dynare) and Eviews.
